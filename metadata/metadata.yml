name: Sparsity Within and Across Overlapping Groups
description: Recently, penalties promoting signals that are sparse within and across
  groups have been proposed. This software demonstrates the use of a generalized penalty
  function, that is more flexible in defining groups, in a simple inverse problem
  formulation. Specifically, the software reproduces the experiment in the associated
  article below.
